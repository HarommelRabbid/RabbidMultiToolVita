## Features
### Database Tools
* **Back up app.db**: Backs up the app database to use it in case of restoring your bubble layout.
* **Restore backed up app.db**: Self-explanatory, restores your previously backed up app database.
* **Update database**: Also self-explanatory, triggers a database update. Doing this wipes your custom themes from the database and you'll have to add them back using a custom themes manager. Official themes aren't affected and will stay.
* **Rebuild database**: Self-explanatory yet again, triggers a database rebuild. Doing so wipes your bubble layout. It can be restored by using the aforementioned backup/restore app database option.
* **Import Media**: Imports media to the database, meaning it can be accessed by using the system media apps.
### App Tools
